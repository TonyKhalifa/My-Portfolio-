<h2>Summary</h2>
I am 30-year-old man, who has just started getting into web development.
But the fact is that I always wanted to get into it, but for one or another reason I did not.
I guess seeing how the world moves You as a person, have to adapt to the environment.
Every day I take time to study and it makes me want to achieve something in the IT field.
Not only, because it is interesting, but I can create something that later could be used by others.
In a sense- become an Artist.
